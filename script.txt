The city of Edinburgh has been my home for the past three years, and I still discover something new every week. When I first arrived from a small town in the south, I was worried that I would feel lost in a busy capital. Instead, I found a place that mixes history and modern life in a way that feels both grand and friendly.

The Royal Mile runs from the castle down to the palace, and it is always full of visitors. Even so, the side streets stay quiet. You can walk for five minutes and find yourself in a lane that looks exactly as it might have done two hundred years ago. The stone buildings, the narrow steps, and the sudden views of the hills make it easy to forget you are in a major European city.

What I like most is how much happens outdoors. In summer, the festival brings performers and crowds from all over the world. In winter, the same streets feel calm and a bit mysterious. When it gets dark early, the lights along Princes Street and the outline of the castle on the rock create a view that never gets boring.

I have also learned that Edinburgh is a good place to study. The university has a strong reputation, and there are libraries and cafés everywhere where you can sit and work. People are used to students and tourists, so nobody minds if you spend an hour in a café with just one drink. The only problem is the weather. It can change from sunshine to rain and back again in a single afternoon. I have stopped leaving the house without a jacket, no matter what the sky looks like in the morning.

If you are thinking of visiting, I would say come in August for the festival, or in December when the Christmas market fills the centre. But honestly, any time of year works. There is always a concert, an exhibition, or simply a new corner of the old town to explore.
